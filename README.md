# File System Utility üìÅ

### **Project Description** üìú

This project is a simple command-line utility built with Node.js that provides basic file system operations.  It allows users to read files, move files, create files, create folders, and exit the program. This is useful for quickly performing common file system tasks without needing a graphical interface.

### **Installation Instructions** üíæ

1. **Ensure Node.js and npm are installed:**  You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this project's repository.

3. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the project's directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

### **Features** ‚ú®

* **Read File:** Reads the content of a specified file and displays it in the console.
* **Move File:** Moves a file from a source path to a destination path.
* **Create File:** Creates a new file at a specified path and writes content to it.
* **Create Folder:** Creates a new folder at a specified path.
* **Exit:** Exits the program.


### **Usage Instructions** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. **Run the script:** Execute the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node your_script_name.js 
   ```
   Replace `your_script_name.js` with the actual name of your JavaScript file (e.g., `fs_utility.js`).

2. **Choose an option:** The program will present a menu with numbered options. Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation (1-5).

3. **Provide input:** Follow the prompts to provide necessary information such as file paths, content, etc.

4. **View results:** The program will display the results of the operation (e.g., file content, success/error messages).


### **Dependencies** üîß

This project uses the following Node.js core modules:

* `fs`: For file system operations (reading, writing, moving, creating files and folders).
* `path`: For working with file and directory paths.
* `readline`: For interacting with the user through the command line.  No external dependencies are required.

### **Commands** ‚öôÔ∏è

```bash
# Run the script
node your_script_name.js

# Example: Read a file
node your_script_name.js  # Select option 1 and provide the file path
```
